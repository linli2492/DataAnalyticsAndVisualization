# Ascertaining the Fair Value of an Asset Using Market Profile and Volume Profile Distribution Curves

## Project Background
In trading and investing, understanding the **value** of an asset can offer an edge over relying purely on price action or fundamental news. 

By identifying areas of value and assessing the structural integrity of price levels, traders can discover opportunities where **price disconnects from fair value** and recognize potential breakout points. 

This project aims to identify those value areas through using Market Profile and Volume Profile distribution curves as well as calculating critical metrics such as **Point of Control (PoC)**, **Poor/Weak Highs and Lows** and **Value Area High (VAH)** and **Value Area Low (VAL).**

**Market Profiles** and **Volume Profiles** provide a view of market activity and value by examining price distrubution over time and traded volume at each price level. 

By aggregating price data and examining where trading activity is concentrated, these profiles offer insight into: 
- **Fair Value**: Identify areas where an asset is likely perceived as fairly valued by the market
- **Areas of Imbalance**: Spot price levels where trading activity is minimal, presenting long or short opportunities should price move into those areas.
- **Market Sentiment**: Assess sentiment by identifying price levels that consistently attract or repel trading activity, reflecting market participants' confidence or lack thereof in those price levels.
