## Welcome to my GitHub Blog

Data is **everywhere** - often publically available and increasingly easy to collect. 

But it's true value lies in how we analyze, dissect and transform it into **actionable insights** that drive smarter decisions 

**Hi, my name is Lin** and welcome to my GitHub!

This blog is a space where I combine my background as an algorithmic trader and data analyst with a broader vision: helping not just traders and investors, but businesses of all kinds turn raw data into insights that matter.

In November 2024, I secured funding from a proprietary trading firm after developing trading and analytical algorithms that identified high-probability setups with asymmetric risk profiles.

What was my edge?

**Analyzing, dissecting and transforming** financial data into clear strategies. 

This blog extends that approach beyond trading. Whether you're:
- A business sitting on untapped data, looking to uncover insights that drive decision-making.
- A hedge fund/asset manager/aspring trader seeking inspiration for analyzing price data to build strategies and manage risk.

You'll find resources, ideas and tools here in my GitHub to maximize the power of your data!

## Repository of Projects

For easeL I have binned my projects into the following repositories: 


1. [**Quantitative Analysis and Visualisation.**](https://github.com/linli2492/ProjectsPortfolio/tree/main/QuantitativeAnalysisAndVisualization)
2. [**Portfolio Management & Risk Analysis**.](https://github.com/linli2492/ProjectsPortfolio/tree/main/PortfolioManagementAndRiskAnalytics)
3. [**Software Development**.](https://github.com/linli2492/ProjectsPortfolio/tree/main/SoftwareDevelopment)

Each category has their own variety of projects with their own documentation.

A majority of the projects are built in ***Python***

Projects that require higher performance, speed and low latency such as computationally expensive algorithms and software are built in ***C++*** or ***C#*** with ***PowerBi and/or Tableau*** for data visualization.

For those of you that are currently involved in proprietary trading: 

I have also built my own trading algorithms using **Ninjascript (C# based language)** and **MQL4/5 (C++ based language)** for traders using NinjaTrader and MetaTrader 4/5. You can find then here: 



## Background

My areas of expertise lie at the intersection of **capital markets, data science, and programming**.

I specialize in transforming vast and complex data sets into actionable insights that provide a real edge to firms and their clients.

With a 6-year career in financial markets (with BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and S&P Global among my former employers), my ability to work with data structures, coupled with a deep knowledge of capital markets, allows me to uncover patterns and insights that are often overlooked.
