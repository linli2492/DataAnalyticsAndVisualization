# Lin Li - Projects Portfolio

## Index
This repository holds all the work I have done over the years that I have used in my own trading & investing operations or have built for my employers that are non proprietary. 

They are currently binned into different categories: 
1. Quantitative Analysis and Visualisation.
3. Portfolio Management & Risk Analysis.
4. Software Development.

Each category has their own variety of projects with their own documentation and will involve some combination of the use of **Python, C#, C++, PowerBI and/or Tableau.**

## Background

My areas of expertise lie at the intersection of **capital markets, data science, and programming**.

I specialize in transforming vast and complex data sets into actionable insights that provide a real edge to firms and their clients.

With a 6-year career in financial markets (with BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and S&P Global among my former employers), my ability to work with data structures, coupled with a deep knowledge of capital markets, allows me to uncover patterns and insights that are often overlooked.

Currently, I am applying these skills as a day trader, utilizing both fundamental and quantitative analysis to create trading algorithms that identify high-probability opportunities in the markets with an asymmetric risk-reward ratio.
