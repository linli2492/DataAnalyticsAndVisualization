## Welcome to my GitHub Blog

Data is **everywhere**—often publicly available and increasingly easy to collect. 

But its true value lies in how we analyze, dissect and transform it into **actionable insights** that drive smarter decisions.

**Hi, my name is Lin** and welcome to my GitHub!

This space is where I combine my expertise in data analytics, statistics and capital markets with a broader vision: helping financial analysts, businesses and consultants turn raw data into actionable insights that matter.

In November 2024, I secured funding from a proprietary trading firm after developing trading and analytical algorithms that identified high-probability setups with asymmetric risk profiles.

What was my edge?

**Analyzing, dissecting and transforming** financial data (mostly price data—it is incredible what you can derive from OHLCV data!) into clear, actionable strategies. 

This blog extends that approach beyond trading. Whether you're:
- A financial analyst seeking inspiration on how you can 'slice and dice' financial data to build trading/investing strategies and manage risk.  
- A business sitting on untapped data, looking to uncover insights that drive decision-making.
- A consulting firm looking for ideas on ways to derive insights from your clients' raw data. 

You'll find resources, ideas and tools here in my GitHub to **maximize the power of your data!**
