# Lin Li - Projects Portfolio

## Index
This repository holds all the work I have done over the years that I have used in my own trading & investing operations or have built for my employers that are non proprietary. 

They are currently binned into different categories: 

1. [**Quantitative Analysis and Visualisation.**](https://github.com/linli2492/ProjectsPortfolio/tree/main/QuantitativeAnalysisAndVisualization)
2. [**Portfolio Management & Risk Analysis**.](https://github.com/linli2492/ProjectsPortfolio/tree/main/PortfolioManagementAndRiskAnalytics)
3. [**Software Development**.](https://github.com/linli2492/ProjectsPortfolio/tree/main/SoftwareDevelopment)

Each category has their own variety of projects with their own documentation and involve some combination of the use of:
- ***Python***
- ***C#***
- ***C++***
- ***PowerBI and/or Tableau.***

For those of you that are currently involved in proprietary trading: 

I have also built my own trading algorithms using **Ninjascript (C# based language)** and **MQL4/5 (C++ based language)** for traders using NinjaTrader and MetaTrader 4/5. You can find then here: 

1. **NinjaTrader Trading Algorithms (Futures)**
2. **MetaTrader 4/5 Expert Advisors (Forex)** 



## Background

My areas of expertise lie at the intersection of **capital markets, data science, and programming**.

I specialize in transforming vast and complex data sets into actionable insights that provide a real edge to firms and their clients.

With a 6-year career in financial markets (with BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and S&P Global among my former employers), my ability to work with data structures, coupled with a deep knowledge of capital markets, allows me to uncover patterns and insights that are often overlooked.

Currently, I am applying these skills as a day trader, utilizing both fundamental and quantitative analysis to create trading algorithms that identify high-probability opportunities in the markets with an asymmetric risk-reward ratio.
