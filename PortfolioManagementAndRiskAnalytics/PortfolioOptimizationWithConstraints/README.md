# Porfolio Optimization using Modern Portfolio Theory with Real World Constraints

The main goal of this project is to develop a portfolio opmization model using modern portfolio theory (MPT) whilst incorporating real-world constraints such as minimum allocations, maximumallocations and liquidity constraints. 

It aims to provide a practical solution that balances risk and return while adhering to practical constraints faced by portfolio managers. 

**Python** will be used for data processing and initial prototyping of an Efficient Frontier. 
**C++** will be used for more computationally intensive parts of the optimization process, particularly custom constraint handling and performance improvements. 

## Relevance of Project
- **MPT's Real World Applicability:** Classic MPT does not consider practical constraints faced by portfolio managers such as sector caps, liquidity constraints, minimum allocation requirements etc. This project adds a layer of realism that aligns with actual conditions faced by investment professionals, making opmization more actionable for real investment strategies.
  
- **Scalability** Leveraging *C++* for optimization with custom constraints, this project will demonstate how large-scale portolios can be efficiently optimized, even with complex constraints.
